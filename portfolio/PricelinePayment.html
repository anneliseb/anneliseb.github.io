        <p class="problem">Priceline has ~30 different checkout experiences/applications. There are also other touchpoints in the customer's journey, such as post-booking, where payments may occur. The goal was to get buy-in and create a strategy for building a front-end payment component.</p>

            <h2>{01} Shared Understanding</h2>
            <p>First, to establish a shared understanding and to get buy-in from my peers, I conducted a payment component definition workshop. The workshop attendees were primarily product managers from different teams, who all work on one or more of those ~30 checkouts.</p>
              <div class="project-sub-section">
                <div>
                  <h3>Method</h3>
                  <p>Conducted a “futurespective” where participants imagined that the payment component has been successfully implemented in the product paths. By doing this, we were able to reflect on our expectations of the component and the steps we would need to take to get there. Futurespectives are used as part of agile within technology but the concept was adapted for this workshop.</p>

                    <h3>Part 1: What is the success criteria of the payment component?</h3>
                    <p>Answer the following questions by imagining a payment component exists and is implemented within checkout of every product path.</p>

                    <p>Next, create a definition of the payment component based on previous thoughts. The definition should consist of an elevator pitch type of sentence and a list of broad “acceptance criteria”.</p>
                    <p>Each group will have [5] minutes to walk through some of their initial thoughts and their definition.</p>

                    <p>How might their objectives match ours? How might their objectives clash with ours? What value could they derive from this work? How might they help sponsor this work?</p>
                    <p>Does the payment component need to interact with any other systems, platforms, components, etc.?</p>

            <p>Next, I took a step back in order to consider the architecture and pieces that make up the payment component, and how the payment component fits into a larger checkout application.</p>

            <h2>{03} Credit Card Component</h2>
            <p>The piece or smaller component, inside the payment component that I focused on first was the credit card component, as this is the most popular form of payment on Priceline today. The credit card component consists of credit card and billing form fields. I started with writing basic form field requirements.</p>
            <p>I used this documentation also, to illustrate how many of our ~30 checkout experiences lacked basic, expected form field functionality.</p>

            <h2>{04} Buy-in and Next Steps</h2>
            <p>Having the support of the product management teams, FE tech teams, and BE payment platform team, I set up time with Priceline’s CPO. I reviewed our payment definition component, the strategy for using this as a stepping stone to get towards a more unified experience and a smarter way of working, and the next steps for continuing this work. The idea was well met and has become a new initiative for the company.</p>
