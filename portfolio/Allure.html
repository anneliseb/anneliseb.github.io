        <p class="problem">Allure.com had not updated their Beauty Product Finder tool in many years. Use of the tool was down, so the editors wanted to explore options of how to better integrate the tool with the rest of the site. The tool provided access to hundreds of beauty product reviews, but the content was not being leveraged and viewed.</p>
        <hr>
        <div class="project-text">
          <h2>{01} Where to start?</h2>
          <p>I started with completing an audit of the current tool and a competitive analysis of similar beauty product recommendation tools. The competitive analysis included filtering systems of current beauty brands and retailers, and tools and quizzes on editorial websites. From the audit and competitive analysis, a light taxonomy was created to understand how the product finder was currently organized and how the facets could be streamlined and updated.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the research team gathered findings from different consumer marketing beauty reports and studies. From this, we were able to understand where Allure stands in relation to consumers/user’s habits and the beauty industry as a whole.</p>

          <h2>{02} So who exactly were our users?</h2>
          <p>I took this information and began to think through who our users are by developing proto-personas. I used demographic and audience information our research team was able to provide from ComScore and created four personas.  The personas included descriptions of their personality, location, behaviors, and motivations—from the college student who likes to go out on the weekend to the mom of three whose focus is anti-aging.
          <p>I then thought through the when our personas would be using the tool and why. Are you sitting at home,  waiting at the salon, or maybe in a drugstore or Sephora? Would you be on a mobile device or your laptop? How do these environments and factors affect your needs and wants from the beauty finder tool.</p>
          <p>A survey was developed at this time to gather quantitative data and usability testing and user interviews were conducted with current Allure.com users to gather qualitative data through a third party. Through this research, I was able to learn about specific behaviors from our users, what they love about Allure, and what else they would love to see.</p>

        <h2>{03} Visualization</h2>
          <p>Specific use cases were developed and “blue sky” design ideas were sketched of not only how we could improve the current tool, but what other new products and instances of the tool could be proposed. A few example of ideas included new ways of integrating the product finder with content, an app for getting ready in the morning based on the weather, and a interactive kiosk with a partner retail store.</p>
          <p>The finished deliverable was a presentation (which included a physical document) of a summary of the research, a proposed new IA of the finder, personas, different environments interaction with the tool may occur, and high level wireframes/sketches of a few of these ideas. The editorial team then took time to review the findings and assess their own content strategy and roadmap of how to progress in the future. This project was still on going at Allure.com after I moved on from Condé Nast.</p>
