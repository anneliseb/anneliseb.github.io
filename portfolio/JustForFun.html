        <h2>{01} Star Wars Trading Cards</h2>
        <p>While at Pratt Institute I created a set of Star Wars trading cards for an information design class. The challenge was finding the best layout of the information that could be templated and work for each Star Wars planet and the different quantity of information for each card.</p>
        <h2>{02} Invitations</h2>
        <p>Wedding invitations created for my sister and brother-in-law. My sister and brother-in-law first met when they were children, so they requested the invitations have a playful childhood theme.</p>
        <p>Baby shower inviations for the birth of my nephew. We decided on an animal ther=me for the party!</p> 
        <h2>{03} Shake Shack Nutritional Infographic</h2>
        <p>Specific use cases were developed and “blue sky” design ideas were sketched of not only how we could improve the current tool, but what other new products and instances of the tool could be proposed. Example of ideas were new ways of integrating the product finder with content, an app for getting ready in the morning based on the weather, and a interactive kiosk with a partner retail store.</p>
        <h2>{04} Palette Knife Illustration</h2>
        <p>For a visual communocations design class, I was aksed to create an illustration of a current event. It wasn't long after U.S. Airways flight 1549 landed in the Hudson River after hitting a bird. I chose to take a comical spin on the event and show Canada Geese plsnning to take down the plane.</p>
