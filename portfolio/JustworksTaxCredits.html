        <h1>Justworks R&D Tax Credits (In progress)</h1>
        <h3>Increasing the amount of eligible customers claiming the R&D tax credit while streamlining the claims process.</h3>
        <section class="overview-item">
              <h4>Background</h4>
              <p>The Federal Research and Development (R&D) Tax Credit is an income tax credit that may be claimed by companies who have expenditures related to the research and development of new processes and products, among other things. To be eligible to claim the credit, companies must meet a series of tests determined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</p>
              <p>In 2015, the Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes (PATH) Act was passed, making R&D credits more accessible to small businesses.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="overview-item">
              <h4>Problem</h4>
              <p>Justworks saw a 9,675% increase in the number of customers submitting claims for R&D between 2016 and 2021. We needed a way to scale processes to receive and review R&D claims. Additionally, it was estimated that 50% of customers may be eligible for R&D tax credits while only 4% were submitting claims, meaning there was an opportunity to educate and spread customer awareness. As part of that effort, Justworks partnered with two accounting firms specializing in R&D tax credits, opening up a new line of revenue.</p>

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>The approach was split into three milestones:</p> 
            <ol>
                <li>Launch a product page on R&D tax credits to spread awareness of accounting partnerships prior to in-app submission flow launch</li>
                <li>Create a new in-app claims submission flow to collect the necessary information and documents from the customer for Justworks to file</li>
                <li>Create a new internal tool for the Client Tax Services team to manage and review customer submissions</li>
