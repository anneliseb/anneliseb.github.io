        <h1>Your Priceline Trip</h1>
          <section class="overview-item">
              <h4>Background</h4>
              <p>Priceline had replatformed most of its FE applications, but one application had yet to be replatformed and that was the order confirmation application. Originally, the order confirmation page had been designed as a single template used by each product, air, hotel, and car. But over the years they got further and further from that original single design.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="overview-item">
              <h4>Problem</h4>
              <p>With a company initiative to grow the number of customers bundling products, Priceline was in need of an order confirmation experience that could take into account a customer booking a single product, or a customer booking 2+ products in the same order.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="overview-item">
              <h4>Goal</h4>
              <p>The goal was to build a single application of reusable common components in react, replacing the old angular pages. And to provide the customer with a single, organized trip itinerary that helped them feel confident in their purchase and provided the necessary self-service tools should they require help.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="overview-item">
              <h4>Team</h4>
              <p>My role was lead product designer. A junior designer worked with me during the first half of the project. The rest of the team consisted of a product manager and 4 FE developers. Our key partners were customer care, finace, and the product teams for the individual product verticals.</p>

          <p>What insights were there to gleam from how customers were interacting with the current confirmation page? When did they return to to it and what did they interact with the most? How did this differ by product or advance purchase window?</p>

          <h2>Story</h2>
          <p>Pricelineâ€™s user researcher and I partnered up and led a workshop to define the customers post booking journey. The group created a 5 chapter story and then for each chapter delved into what the customers mindset may be.</p>
          <p>This exercise also clarified scope. The first 3 chapters of the story we defined as in scope and the last 2 chapters in the story were moved to out of scope.</p>

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>During the research and ideation phase of this project, I was still lead designer for the flights team. A challenge of this project was juggling design for multiple teams at once. A positive was being on multiple teams meant having a background in key product requirements and regulations..</P>
          <p>I would have liked to have had more up front time for research and more time to think through the architecture of a full post-booking experience, rather than focus mainly on the confirmation page.</P>
          <p>One of the goals was to build a strong, flexible base, knowing we may need to pivot or grow experience in the future, which the team successfully accomplished.</P>
