        <p class="problem">Flights was Priceline's first product, but had been neglected over the years. The Priceline Group made a decision to invest in a new Flights product team to make the online experience of booking a flight great again. With the growth of mobile, we focused first on the mobile web path. We then built up from mobile into a new responsive path.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>{01} Learn More About the Flights Product</h2>
        <p>To start we had a list of questions to answer, such as:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>What does the competitive space look like?</li>
        	<li>Who is our customer?</li>
        	<li>How do people search for a flight?</li>
        	<li>How do people plan their trip?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I collaborated with our product manager on competitive research and analytics data and conducted user research into a comprehensive report that allowed us to plan our requirements for the MVP. Our main focus for the MVP was helping users search and book a flight and did not heavily focus on the post booking experience.</p>

        <h2>{02} How do we build it?</h2>
        <p>The product and tech team got together to discuss the best way to build the new flights experience. We decided to entirely scrap the old flights website early on since the code was old and broken. Then, after talking about development and design implications of a single app vs multiple applications decided to split the site into three different applications. And though out of scope for the initial MVP, we tried to keep in mind that this could be built up to be responsive.</p>
        <p>Because I was a single designer working with a large team of 7-9 FE developers, the devs started building from wireframes and prototypes.</p>
        <h2>{03} Visual Design</h2>
        <p>As the developers built out the core functionality, I had time to then focus on and finalize the visual designs and smaller interactions of the path.</p>
        <h2>{04} Responsive Design</h2>
        <p>After the success of the new mobile web path we set our sites to the desktop experience. We utilized the great work done on mobile and built the experience up onto larger screens sizes. We did this first for checkout, entirely replacing the checkout flow and then built search and listings up through tablet. Because desktop listings was much more complicated, we took a slower, iterative testing approach opposed to replacing the entire design in one go.</p>
        <h2>{05} The Results</h2>
        <ul>
        	<li>Initial A/B test of pushing 10% of traffic to the new mobile web path saw a conversion increase of more than 13%.</li>
        	<li>Responsive checkout experience had an approximate increase of 5% over the old desktop checkout.</li>
        	<li>First responsive product path on Priceline</li>
        	<li>A successful foundation to build up from and add new features to that will provide a better experience for customers.</li>
        </ul>
