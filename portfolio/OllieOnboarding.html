        <h1>Ollie Onboarding Refresh</h1>
          <section class="overview-item">
              <h4>Background</h4>
              <p>Ollie is a dog food D2C subsciption company. They needed to replatform the entirety of both their FE and BE. There was quite a bit of tech debt and the there were big changes coming our way, such as a rebrand and new subsciption models to be sold.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="overview-item">
              <h4>Problem</h4>
              <p>Technology’s plan was to replatform the FE starting at the beginning of the customer funnel. I had approximately 3 weeks to find the current problems with the onboarding flow and do a “refresh” of the design.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="overview-item">
              <h4>Goal</h4>
              <p>To build a new onboarding flow in react utilizing new design system foundations and components. UX improvements would increase current onboarding conversion (initiated onboarding to plan page).</p>
            </section>
            <section class="overview-item">
              <h4>Team</h4>
              <p>My role was senior product designer. The rest of the team consisted of a product manager and 4 FE developers. Our key partners were marketing, CX, and strategy.</p>

            <h2>Supporting Data</h2>
            <p>I focused on onboarding funnel conversion data wanting to learn where in the flow visitors were dropping off. This data was split a few different ways such as mobile vs desktop. I also looked into how many visitors drop off from onboarding and then return and complete onboarding at a later time. Below shows overall onboarding funnel conversion step by step. The majority of drop off happens at the time of email collection.</p>

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>As a starting place besides looking at available data, I observed users interacting with the current onboading flow experience. I paid attention to any questions users seemed to get stuck on or weren’t comprehending as well as how they interacted with the prototype. Participans had the oportunity to give open feedback at the end and were asked questions on how long they perceived the onboaarding flow to be.</p>

            <h2>Focus Areas</h2>
            <p>Synthesizing the data and user research, along with information gathered from Ollie’s business strategist, I defined the areas of improvement into the different themes and began to work on solutions to the problems.</p>

                  <h4>Future marketing moments</h4>
                  <p>While looking at competitors such as Farmer’s Dog and Nom Nom Now, I noticed that that some asked for dogs weight and others for birth date. Ollie was currently asking for age, but I realized that knowing birth date could lead to future marketing moments. I brought this to the marketing director who loved the idea.</p>
                  <p>But, this is also a question that could stump a customer. While some dog owners know their dog’s age and birthday as if they were their child, others did not. For that reason, day was kept optioal and through messaging, reassured the customer that they could take their best guess if they weren’t sure.</p>

              <h4>Less is more</h4>
              <p>Knowing that the largest area of drop-off in onboarding was during the first couple steps, I decided to combine the intro “Get started” page with the email capture. The hope is that this would make the user feel like they’re getting into the expereince sooner with less time to decide they want to leave.</p>
              <p>Also, the current experience had a % savings banner on every screen. When bombarded with the same message over and over again you can stop seeing it. Instead, our new stragey was to put the savings message up in key areas of the experience, the first step and interstital loadin page, as a reminder to keep going to get the savings.</p>
