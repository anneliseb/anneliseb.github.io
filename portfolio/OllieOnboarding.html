        <h1>Ollie Onboarding Refresh</h1>
          <section class="overview-item">
              <h4>Background</h4>
              <p>Ollie is a dog food D2C subsciption company. They needed to replatform the entirety of both their FE and BE. There was quite a bit of tech debt and the there were big changes coming our way, such as a rebrand and new subsciption models to be sold.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="overview-item">
              <h4>Problem</h4>
              <p>Technology’s plan was to replatform the FE starting at the beginning of the customer funnel. I had approximately 3 weeks to find the current problems with the onboarding flow and do a “refresh” of the design.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="overview-item">
              <h4>Goal</h4>
              <p>To build a new onboarding flow in react utilizing new design system foundations and components. UX improvements would increase current onboarding conversion (initiated onboarding to plan page).</p>
            </section>
            <section class="overview-item">
              <h4>Team</h4>
              <p>My role was senior product designer. The rest of the team consisted of a product manager and 4 FE developers. Our key partners were marketing, CX, and strategy.</p>

            <h2>Supporting Data</h2>
            <p>I focused on onboarding funnel conversion data wanting to learn where in the flow visitors were dropping off. This data was split a few different ways such as mobile vs desktop. I also looked into how many visitors drop off from onboarding and then return and complete onboarding at a later time. Below shows overall onboarding funnel conversion step by step. The majority of drop off happens at the time of email collection.</p>

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>As a starting place besides looking at available data, I observed users interacting with the current onboading flow experience. I paid attention to any questions users seemed to get stuck on or weren’t comprehending as well as how they interacted with the prototype. Participans had the oportunity to give open feedback at the end and were asked questions on how long they perceived the onboaarding flow to be.</p>

            <h2>Focus Areas</h2>
            <p>Synthesizing the data and user research, along with information gathered from Ollie’s business strategist, I defined the areas of improvement into the different themes and began to work on solutions to the problems.</p>

               <h4>Future marketing moments</h4>
               <p>While looking at competitors such as Farmer’s Dog and Nom Nom Now, I noticed that that some asked for dogs weight and others for birth date. Ollie was currently asking for age, but I realized that knowing birth date could lead to future marketing moments. I brought this to the marketing director who loved the idea.</p>
               <p>But, this is also a question that could stump a customer. While some dog owners know their dog’s age and birthday as if they were their child, others did not. For that reason, day was kept optioal and through messaging, reassured the customer that they could take their best guess if they weren’t sure.</p>

              <h4>Less is more</h4>
              <p>Knowing that the largest area of drop-off in onboarding was during the first couple steps, I decided to combine the intro “Get started” page with the email capture. The hope is that this would make the user feel like they’re getting into the expereince sooner with less time to decide they want to leave.</p>
              <p>Also, the current experience had a % savings banner on every screen. When bombarded with the same message over and over again you can stop seeing it. Instead, our new stragey was to put the savings message up in key areas of the experience, the first step and interstital loadin page, as a reminder to keep going to get the savings.</p>

               <h4>Branding opportunity</h4>
               <p>Who doesn’t love a cute dog photo? During user research, participants would commonly say they’d love to see more photos of dogs. Ollie was also going through a rebrand and was starting to lean away from illustrations and more towards photos.</p>
               <p>While it was important to not inundate the experience with photos, there were areas where photos could reinfornce the brand. One opportunity was on the breed question (mentioned by a research participant) as a way to visualize that Ollie is made for all dog breeds no matter the size.</p>

                 <h4>Combining like questions</h4>
                 <p>The current flow has a single focused question on each page. There could be a good argument for asking one question at a time, but there are questions that relate to each other. Having these related questions come one after the other or combining them on a page could make the quiz feel shorter than it is.</p>

               <p>During user testing, a couple of questions stood out as confusing or not obvious as to why we were asking it. I wanted to design a way to add in this extra contextual information, without it getting the way of a customer continuing through the flow.</p>

               <h4>Quiz progress</h4>
               <p>In the current experience the quiz was considered the first step in signing up for Ollie with the second being meal selection, and the third, checkout. Even though the quiz was 12 steps, there was a progress indicator saying 1/3 for the entire 12 steps.</p>
               <p>This was easy to identify as a problem. The approach I went with was to forgo the full onboarding progress indicator and focus on quiz progression. There were other indicators after the quiz such as a “continue to checkout” button that signaled to the user what was up next and that they were almost done.</p>

                <h4>Allergies</h4>
                <p>The last question we ask in the quiz is around food allergies. Instead of an input field I was curious to see if there was an easier way for customers to select , but first I needed to learn more about dog food allergies.</p>
                <p>I spoke with out head of food to learn what commern allergens will never be in our food, CX to learn what allergens customers call in about, and I took a looks at data to see what allergens customers select the most.</p>
                <p>I was able to learn there were a few allergies which were often selected by customers so I updated the design to make it easy for a customer to select a top allergy, but still search for other allergies.</p>

          <h2>Design System Components</h2>
          <p>The FE lead and I had been in discussions about deisnging and developing a design system for Ollie. I created foundation styles I had been using in designs for a couple months and a FE intern had added them into Storybook. The replatfrom of onboarding provided the perfect reason to build out additional components that could be used throughout the experience.</p>

            <li>After a week of going live conversion from onboarding to the next step (meal plan selection) increased by 10%.</li>
            <li>9 new common components were designed and developed including a primary button, chip, input, select, progress indicator, and banner.</li>
            <li>The onboarding flow was decreased from 12–13 steps to 8 steps, getting visitors through the flow faster, without losing any critical information.</li>

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>This initiative was timeboxed to be 3 weeks for design work. If I had more itme I may have looked into conducting competitive usability testing and/or explored alternative ways to gather information from from visitors ourtide of the quiz format.</P>
          <p>Technolody and product waited to discuss how we were going to tackle building the new onboarding, resulting in design having to scramble to get the details of the components together and ready for engineering to build.</P>
          <p>In the month prior to this work product had made the case of needing a usability testing tool to leadership. I would not have been able to move as quickly or with as much confidence if I didn't have a usability testing tool to utilize.</P>
