        <p class="problem">The New Yorker team had been working on a redesign for many months. They were building a new, fully responsive site and were coordinating with the print creative team, as the redesign was across all media. I was asked to jump in and help the team finish up a few final sections of the website.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>{01} Fluid Responsive Sit</h2>
        <p>One of the diffuculties when creating a </p>
        <p>At the same time, the research team gathered findings from different consumer marketing beauty reports and studies. From this we were able to understand where Allure stands in relation to consumers/user’s habits and the beauty industry as a whole.</p>
        <h2>{02} So who exactly were our users?</h2>
        <p>I took this information and began to think through who our users are by developing proto-personas. I used demographic and audience information our research team was able to provide from ComScore and created four personas.  The personas included descriptions of their personality, location, behaviors, and motivations—from the college student who likes to go out on the weekend to the mom of three whose focus is anti-aging.
        <p>I then thought through the when our personas would be using the tool and why. Are you sitting at home,  waiting at the salon, or maybe in a drugstore or Sephora? Would you be on a mobile device or your laptop? How do these environments and factors affect your needs and wants from the beauty finder tool.</p>
        <p>A survey was developed at this time to gather quantitative data and usability testing and user interviews were conducted with current Allure.com users to gather qualitative data through a third party. I was able to learn about specific behaviors from our users, what they love about Allure, and what else they would love to see.</p>
        <h2>{03} Visualization</h2>
        <p>Specific use cases were developed and “blue sky” design ideas were sketched of not only how we could improve the current tool, but what other new products and instances of the tool could be proposed. Example of ideas were new ways of integrating the product finder with content, an app for getting ready in the morning based on the weather, and a interactive kiosk with a partner retail store.</p>
        <p>The finished deliverable was a presentation (which included a physical document) of a summary of the research, a proposed new IA of the finder, personas, different environments interaction with the tool may occur, and high level wireframes/sketches of a few of these ideas. The editorial team then took time to review the findings and assess their own content strategy and roadmap of how to progress in the future. This project was still on going at Allure.com after I moved on from Condé Nast.</p>
