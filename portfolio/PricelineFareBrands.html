        <p class="problem">Airlines have struggled in the past to make a profit, but the last couple of years have seen a positive change in profitability. There have been many different drivers behind this, one of which is the sale of ancillaries. This project focused on how to include ancillaries, through branded fares, on Priceline.com.</p>

          	<h2>{01} The Background</h2>
          	<p>So what are ancillaries and branded fares? Ancillaries are the extras such as, seat choice, checked bags, wifi, etc. that the airline’s may charge you for outside of the base ticket price. Branded fares are when airlines group a bunch of ancillaries together into a fare. The higher the fare, the more ancillaries are included in your ticket.</p>
          	<p>Why do the airlines do this? It’s partly the consumer’s fault. Historically, whenever airlines have done things to try to improve the flight experience, like increase legroom, they must increase the cost of the tickets to offset what they're giving you. This causes people to complain that the ticket cost is too expensive. People want a great flight experience, but they don't want to pay for it. On average worldwide, airlines only make a revenue of $6/passenger because costs are so high (fuel). So, airlines are now charging for ancillaries to bring base prices down because they know that people will always be attracted to the lowest price. Then if customers really want the extras, they can pay more for it.</p>

          	<h2>{02} Incorporating into Priceline</h2>
          	<p>We first worked with Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, and United Airlines to include their basic economy tickets within the flights tickets offered on Priceline.com, and the ability to upgrade to higher, and more expensive fares. Although, I knew after talking with development, that we would have to add fare brands into checkout because of how the price confirmation worked, I ran a usability test within the office with two different user flows. One, showed the fare brand options within the checkout steps. The second, asked users to select a fare brand within the flight details screen before checkout. I was able to learn that what the user preferred directly correlated with 1) does the user have a family and 2) income. People who travel alone and have a lower income preferred to see the options in checkout, where they could easily skip over the upgrades, as it is something they wouldn’t consider. People with a higher income and families preferred to see fare brand options upfront so they didn’t waste their time buying a flight that didn’t have the ancillary options they wanted.</p>

          	<h2>{03} Design and Complexity</h2>
          	<p>One of the complexities with this project was that every airline handles branded fares in a slightly different way and each of our partners had a few special requests. What information we were able to include on each fare was also dictated by the GDS we pulled the information from. With that said, my goal was to present the information in a clear way that allowed easy comparison.</p>

            <h2>{04} Results</h2>
            <p>The intial launch of basic economy fares within listings saw a ~1.7% increase in conversion. Approximately 6 months after launching fare brands on Delta Air Lines, we learned that out of all the customers who book premium economy cabin tickets (Delta Comfort+) 65% of them were upgrading through fare brands in checkout, and 35% were from searching premium economy on the hp. Most of the flight searches are for the economy cabin class, so selling upgraded fares through checkout (and later post booking) is a big win.</p>

          	<h2>{05} Reworking the User Flow</h2>
          	<p>After over a year of first introducing branded fares on the site, we made the decision to move fare brand options up to the details page. This decision was largely influenced by a universal checkout initiative going on at the time.</p>

          <h2>{06} Native iOS and Android Apps</h2>
          <p>To get the best deals on the native apps, the iOS and Andriod teams added Basic Econonmy flight and fare brands to their flights paths. I completed the design and worked with the flights PM, apps PM, and apps developers for both iOS ans Android to get this new experience out. The Android team saw a ~7.5 conversion gain from this A/B test.</p>
